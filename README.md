An app idea to help the users read faster

## About the idea

Using the same concept on some videos in the internet, the idea is to make
an app that shows words rapidly, one by one. [Heres an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yddeRrd0hA).
With that we can read faster, and get the info on those texts faster as well.
